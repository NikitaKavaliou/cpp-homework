\# My C++ Homework Stuff



Hi! This is my small repository where I put all my C++ programs.  

I’m still learning, so the code here is simple, sometimes a bit messy,  

but it works and helps me understand how C++ actually functions.



\## What’s inside

Most files are tiny exercises about basic things like:



\- input and output  

\- variables and math  

\- loops (for, while)  

\- functions  

\- formatting with `iomanip`  

\- small algorithms  

\- beginner‑style comments (because I explain things to myself)



Nothing too serious — just practice while I learn.



\## How to run the programs

If you want to run any file, you can compile it like this:



g++ filename.cpp -o program

./program



Code



This is what I use while testing my homework.



\## Why I made this repo

I wanted a place to keep all my C++ homework together  

and also get used to GitHub.  

It’s cool to see progress over time, even if the programs are small.



\## Notes

The comments in the code are intentionally simple,  

because I write them as a beginner trying to understand each step.  

So don’t expect professional explanations — just honest learning.

Thanks for checking out my repository :)
